# polygon-arbiter
Manages gameserver requests sent from the Project Polygon website

This is the backend service that was used to handle the launching and shutdown of dedicated gameservers on Project Polygon, with development having started in December 2021 and subsequently used in production in February 2022.

While developing the gameserver system, I recorded a few demo videos of the arbiter in action, which I've linked below:
 - [Proof of concept demo](https://youtu.be/bszlNpBIRTo)
 - [Website integration demo](https://youtu.be/XF-MD0K5IOA)

I've published this here purely for archival purposes, however I've had to omit the commit history from this release due to sensitive info being contained in the configs. I don't recommend that you use this in your work, but I won't stop you.
